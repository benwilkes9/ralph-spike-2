0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/` and tests are in `tests/`.
0e. Before starting new work, check `git status` for uncommitted changes from a previous iteration. If any exist, review them and `git add -A && git commit` with a message describing those changes, then `git push`.
0f. Review project-level files (`README.md`, etc.) and plan updates needed so that a new developer can clone the repo, follow the README, and have the app running. Include documentation tasks in the plan.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns.

TASK FORMAT: Each task in the plan must follow this structure:
- **Title** with a `[ ]` (incomplete) or `[x]` (complete) checkbox. Mark tasks `[x]` if the code and tests already exist and pass — verify by searching the codebase, do not assume.
- **Description** of what to implement.
- **Spec(s):** which spec file(s) the task derives from. The build loop uses this to know which specs to read.
- **Tests:** specific, concrete test scenarios derived from acceptance criteria. Each test should describe a verifiable outcome, not vague assertions (e.g., "tests pass"). Tests verify WHAT works (behavior, edge cases), not HOW it's implemented.
- **Status:** `[ ]` or `[x]`

PRIORITY ORDER: Sort tasks by dependency and priority — foundational tasks first (dependencies, DB layer, app scaffold), then core features, then advanced features, then cross-cutting concerns (error handling, validation), then documentation.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.

CONVERGENCE: If IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md already exists and covers all specs, verify correctness but do NOT rewrite or restyle it. Only commit if you found a factual error or a missing task.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Production-ready REST API

COMMIT: When you have made changes to any files (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, specs, etc.), `git add -A` then `git commit` with a message describing the changes, then `git push`. If nothing changed, do not create an empty commit.
